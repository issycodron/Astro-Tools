# astro-tools

Quick python scripts for common calculations I do with my research work.

bic.py calcuates the Bayesion Information Criterion associated with chi2 outputs from my modelling.

mastoau.py converts milli-arcsecond sizes to au, given the object distance in parsecs.

resolution.py gives you the interferometry telescope telescope when given a baseline length and wavelength.

temp.py calculates the temperature of the sublimation rim of a protoplanetary disc (Monnier & Millan-Gabet 2002)
